# cl — a session picker for Claude Code

Date: 2026-09-03

## Problem

`claude` starts a new session. Returning to an earlier conversation means
`claude -r`, whose picker is scoped to the current directory and offers no
model choice. With 149 transcripts across 24 project directories, finding "the
one about the flaky auth test" is guesswork.

## Goal

One command, `cl`, that lists resumable sessions with readable titles, groups
them by proximity to where you are, lets you pick a model in the same breath,
and defaults to starting something new. Fast enough to type reflexively.

## What the data already gives us

Verified against the live store before designing anything:

- Sessions are `~/.claude/projects/<munged-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`. Of 261 `.jsonl`
  files, 112 are subagent sidechains in nested `<uuid>/subagents/`
  directories; 149 are real sessions, totalling 277MB, largest 63MB.
- Claude writes an `ai-title` record — a real sentence describing the
  conversation — but only 30 of 149 sessions have one. When present it is
  always within the last 64KB.
- Every user and assistant record carries `cwd`, `gitBranch` and
  `message.model`. The first human prompt is within the first 64KB for 113 of
  120 sessions that have one; widening to 1MB gains only two more.
- `claude` already supports `--resume <id>`, `--fork-session`, `--model` and
  `--session-id`.

## Design

### Metadata extraction

Read a 64KB head window and a 64KB tail window per transcript; read files under
256KB whole. Within a window, prefilter each line for a byte marker
(`"type":"ai-title"`, `"type":"assistant"`, …) before `json.Unmarshal`, so
parsing never touches the megabytes of tool output in between. Partial records
at window edges are dropped.

Head yields the opening prompts and `cwd`; tail yields the freshest `ai-title`,
the model last used, and the preview turns. `cwd` falls back to the tail for
sessions whose head is entirely hook records, and then to a sibling session in
the same project directory — every transcript there was recorded from the same
directory, which is exact rather than guessing at the mangled directory name.

Measured alternatives:

| Strategy | Cost | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Full read and parse | 231ms warm, worse cold | rejected |
| Head + tail windows | ~40ms for the whole store | **chosen** |
| Windows plus an on-disk cache | ~5ms | rejected: saves 35ms, adds staleness bugs |

Sessions with no human turn, or with no resolvable working directory, are
omitted — there is nothing in them to resume.

### Titles

`ai-title` when present, marked with a `·`. Otherwise the opening prompt,
chosen by: skip prompts under 18 runes (sessions often open "ok", "resume",
"Yoo!" and carry the real request a turn later), prefer prose over pasted
material (URLs, `KEY=value`, low letter or space ratio), and fall back through
pasted, then short, so a title is empty only when there were no prompts.
Sessions whose opening prompts are all weak get one bounded 2MB deeper scan;
only a handful of sessions pay it. Scheduled runs are titled from the
`scheduled-task name="…"` attribute.

Injected wrappers — system reminders, command output, hook results — are
stripped with their contents. RE2 has no backreferences, so each wrapper name
gets its own attribute-tolerant pattern; content inside unrecognised tags is
kept rather than guessed at.

### Sections

`HERE` (exact cwd), `REPO` (the rest of the git repository found by walking up
for `.git`, accepting the file form so linked worktrees resolve to themselves),
`ALL PROJECTS` (everything else, capped at 40). Empty sections are dropped
except `HERE`, which always exists because it holds the `New session` row.

The cwd is resolved through `filepath.EvalSymlinks`: Claude records the resolved
path, so on macOS an unresolved `/tmp` would file every `/private/tmp` session
under `ALL PROJECTS`.

### Model selection

A persistent footer list, cycled with `←→`. It follows the highlighted row, so
`⏎` continues a conversation on the model it was having; `New session` uses the
`model` from `settings.json`, which is placed first in the list. Pressing `←→`
pins the choice and stops it following the cursor. Recorded ids map to aliases
(`claude-opus-4-7` → `opus`) so the picker keeps working as models ship;
unrecognised ids leave the configured default in charge.

### Launch

`syscall.Exec` replaces the process, so no wrapper sits between the terminal and
claude. Resume and fork `chdir` into the session's directory first.

Note on that chdir, corrected during implementation: `--resume` locates a
session by id from *any* directory — verified with a throwaway session. The
chdir is still required, for a different reason: resuming elsewhere runs the
conversation against the wrong `CLAUDE.md`, relative paths and git repository,
and appends records carrying that other directory to the transcript (observed:
7 such records after one wrong-directory resume).

### Search

Each whitespace-separated term must match, either as a substring of
title + directory + branch + model, or as a *local* subsequence of the title —
a subsequence held within a span of `max(3n, n+6)` runes, and only for terms of
three runes or more. The locality cap is what makes it meaningful: an
unconstrained subsequence search over title + path + model let "heap" match
"add webhook retry" by collecting letters from the directory and the model
name.

### Deletion

`d` confirms, then *moves* the transcript to `~/.claude/.trash-cl/<date>/`,
namespaced by project directory, taking the session's subagent directory with
it. Transcripts hold hours of conversation and tens of megabytes; a keystroke
should not destroy that irreversibly.

## Testing

Parsing, grouping, filtering, title selection and argv construction are pure
functions over bytes and structs, covered by table-driven tests including
truncated window lines, malformed JSON, missing `ai-title`, sessions with no
human turn, worktree `.git` files, unicode, sibling-directory paths
(`/repo-tools` must not count as inside `/repo`) and a malformed settings file.

The TUI is tested by feeding `KeyMsg` sequences to `Update` and asserting state:
navigation skips headers and stops at the ends, `⏎` distinguishes new from
resume, fork refuses the `New session` row, delete asks first, search filters
and `esc` restores, and `View` renders at five terminal sizes and in every mode.

Two live tests read the real store: one asserts the scan stays under 500ms and
that titles and directories resolve, one prints a real frame for eyeballing.
`Exec` is tested for real in a child process against a stand-in `claude` that
reports its argv and working directory.

## Out of scope for v1

Background sessions (`claude --bg`, `claude agents`), cloud sessions, renaming
sessions, and multi-select.
